# The-Game-Of-Genetics

This is a hobby project about creating a genetic algorithm which can create fancy objects in John Conway's Game of Life

## TODO

- Find the proper tools for the job
  - Python is our language of choice
  - Probably https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/seagull to represent the game
- Find some time for this sh*t
